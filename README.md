Guess the country based on its silhouette!

GeoShape Challenge is an interactive geography game where players must identify a country based on its outline. The game dynamically selects a random country based on the chosen continent and minimum size, then displays its silhouette for the player to guess. 

The project was built as a learning exercise to explore the fundamentals of React and TypeScript while working with APIs and interactive mapping. The user interface is styled using Bootstrap, for a better aesthetic. Leaflet.js is used for map rendering, allowing for precise visualization of country borders. To retrieve country data, the game integrates the OpenDataSoft API for geographical boundaries and the RestCountries API for additional details

The game allows players to select a continent and a minimum country size by clicking on the customization-dropdown. Based on these preferences, a random country is chosen, and only its silhouette is displayed on the map. The player then attempts to identify the country by entering a guess.
